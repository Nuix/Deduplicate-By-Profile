# Overview



# Getting Started

## Setup

Begin by downloading the latest release of this code.  Extract the contents of the archive into your Nuix scripts directory.  In Windows the script directory is likely going to be either of the following:

# Usage



# Cloning this Repository

This script relies on code from [Nx](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx) to present a settings dialog and progress dialog.  This JAR file is not included in the repository (although it is included in release downloads).  If you clone this repository, you will also want to obtain a copy of Nx.jar by either:
1. Building it from [the source](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx)
2. Downloading an already built JAR file from the [Nx releases](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx/releases)

Once you have a copy of Nx.jar, make sure to include it in the same directory as the script.

This script also relies on code from [SuperUtilities](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities).  This JAR file is not included in the repository (although it is included in release downloads).  If you clone this repository, you will also want to obtain a copy of SuperUtilities.jar by either:
1. Building it from [the source](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities)
2. Downloading an already built JAR file from the [SuperUtilities releases](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities/releases)

Once you also have a copy of SuperUtilities.jar, make sure to include it in the same directory as the script.
